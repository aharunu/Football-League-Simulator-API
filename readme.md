## üöÄ API Endpoints & Implementation

### Core Simulation Engine
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/simulate/week` | POST | Simulate one week of matches
| `/simulate/all` | POST | Simulate entire remaining season
| `/reset` | POST | Reset league to initial state

### Data Retrieval  
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/standings` | GET | Current league table |
| `/matches` | GET | All fixtures (played/unplayed) |
| `/predict` | GET | Championship probabilities |

### Match Management
| Endpoint | Method | Description | 
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/match/edit` | POST | Edit specific match result |

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "match_id": 1,
  "home_goals": 2,
  "away_goals": 1
}
```

## üß™ API Testing & Validation

### Production Postman Collection

A dedicated Postman collection is included for the live production instance. All endpoints are pre-configured with the production base URL:

- **Base URL:** `https://league-simulator-282922766146.europe-west1.run.app`
- **Usage:** Import `collection.json` into Postman to test the live API endpoints directly. All requests are already configured to use the production base URL, so no additional environment setup is required.

**Quick Test Endpoints:**
```bash
# Get current standings
curl https://league-simulator-282922766146.europe-west1.run.app/standings

# Simulate one week
curl -X POST https://league-simulator-282922766146.europe-west1.run.app/simulate/week

# Get championship predictions (after week 4)
curl https://league-simulator-282922766146.europe-west1.run.app/predict
```

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and Initialize**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aharunu/Football-League-Simulator-API.git
   cd Football-League-Simulator-API
   go mod download
   ```

2. **Run Application**
   ```bash
   go run .
   # Server starts at http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/standings
   # Should return standings
   ```

4. **Test All Functionalities**
   ```bash
   # 1. View landing page
   curl http://localhost:8080/
   
   # 2. Check initial empty standings
   curl http://localhost:8080/standings
   
   # 3. View all unplayed matches
   curl http://localhost:8080/matches
   
   # 4. Simulate first week
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/week
   
   # 5. Check updated standings after week 1
   curl http://localhost:8080/standings
   
   # 6. Simulate 3 more weeks (total 4 weeks for predictions)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/week
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/week
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/week
   
   # 7. Get championship predictions (available after week 4)
   curl http://localhost:8080/predict
   
   # 8. Edit a match result
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/match/edit \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"match_id":1,"home_goals":5,"away_goals":0}'
   
   # 9. Check standings after manual edit
   curl http://localhost:8080/standings
   
   # 10. Simulate all remaining matches
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/all
   
   # 11. View final standings
   curl http://localhost:8080/standings
   
   # 12. Reset league to start over
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/reset
   ```
## üê≥ Run with Docker

You can build and run the API using Docker without installing Go locally:

### 1. Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t football-league-simulator .
```
### 2. Run The Container
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 football-league-simulator
```
The API will now be accessible at:
http://localhost:8080

### 3. Test Endpoints
```bash
# Get current standings
curl http://localhost:8080/standings

# Simulate one week of matches
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/week

# View all matches
curl http://localhost:8080/matches
```

## üíæ Database Schema Design

```sql
-- Team entity with strength rating
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    strength INTEGER NOT NULL  -- Used in simulation algorithm
);

-- Match entity with complete game state
CREATE TABLE matches (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    home_team_id INTEGER,
    away_team_id INTEGER,
    home_goals INTEGER,
    away_goals INTEGER,
    played BOOLEAN,
    week INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (home_team_id) REFERENCES teams(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (away_team_id) REFERENCES teams(id)
);

-- League standings with comprehensive statistics
CREATE TABLE standings (
    team_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    played INTEGER,
    won INTEGER,
    drawn INTEGER,
    lost INTEGER,
    goals_for INTEGER,
    goals_against INTEGER,
    goal_diff INTEGER,
