## üöÄ API Endpoints & Implementation

### Core Simulation Engine
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/simulate/week` | POST | Simulate one week of matches
| `/simulate/all` | POST | Simulate entire remaining season
| `/reset` | POST | Reset league to initial state

### Data Retrieval  
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/standings` | GET | Current league table |
| `/matches` | GET | All fixtures (played/unplayed) |
| `/predict` | GET | Championship probabilities |

### Match Management
| Endpoint | Method | Description | 
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/match/edit` | POST | Edit specific match result |

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "match_id": 1,
  "home_goals": 2,
  "away_goals": 1
}
```

## üíæ Database Schema Design

```sql
-- Team entity with strength rating
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    strength INTEGER NOT NULL  -- Used in simulation algorithm
);

-- Match entity with complete game state
CREATE TABLE matches (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    home_team_id INTEGER,
    away_team_id INTEGER,
    home_goals INTEGER,
    away_goals INTEGER,
    played BOOLEAN,
    week INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (home_team_id) REFERENCES teams(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (away_team_id) REFERENCES teams(id)
);

-- League standings with comprehensive statistics
CREATE TABLE standings (
    team_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    played INTEGER,
    won INTEGER,
    drawn INTEGER,
    lost INTEGER,
    goals_for INTEGER,
    goals_against INTEGER,
    goal_diff INTEGER,
    points INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id)
);
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Go 1.24+** (Uses latest language features)
- **Docker** (Optional, for containerization)
- **Google Cloud CLI** (For production deployment)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and Initialize**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aharunu/Football-League-Simulator-API.git
   cd Football-League-Simulator-API
   go mod download
   ```

2. **Run Application**
   ```bash
   go run .
   # Server starts at http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/standings
   # Should return empty standings array: []
   ```

4. **Test Core Functionality**
   ```bash
   # Simulate first week
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/week
   
   # Check updated standings
   curl http://localhost:8080/standings
   ```

## üß™ API Testing & Validation

### Production Postman Collection

A dedicated Postman collection is included for the live production instance. All endpoints are pre-configured to use the production base URL:

- **Base URL:** `https://league-simulator-282922766146.europe-west1.run.app`
- **Usage:** Import `collection.json` and select the "Production" environment to test live API endpoints.

**Quick Test Endpoints:**
```bash
# Get current standings
curl https://league-simulator-282922766146.europe-west1.run.app/standings

# Simulate one week
curl -X POST https://league-simulator-282922766146.europe-west1.run.app/simulate/week

# Get championship predictions (after week 4)
curl https://league-simulator-282922766146.europe-west1.run.app/predict
```
